### React IME-Safe TextInput Component

This React component is designed to provide a text input that is IME (Input Method Editor) safe while still allowing the submission of the form using the Enter key.
This is particularly useful when dealing with IMEs that use the Enter key to accept predictions, potentially conflicting with your custom submission functionality.
